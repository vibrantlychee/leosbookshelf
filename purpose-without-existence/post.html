            <a href="https://www.google.com/">There exists a special place in the science fiction canon reserved for Sir Ridley Scott’s</a> <i>Blade Runner</i> (1982), a film that has by now not only achieved cult-favourite status, but also sits beside other iconic films such as <i>Back to the Future</i> in the category of ‘films set in a future year that is now behind us’ (it’s 2022 and still no hoverboards nor replicants). While we are still about thirty years out from the titular year of Villeneuve’s slower, more contemplative <i>Blade Runner 2049</i>, the sequel is by no means disconnected from the grim realities of the current day.

            For the younger generation, life seems to resemble more and more an <i>existence without purpose</i>. Day to day, young people grapple with the rat race that is one’s professional career. Indeed in China, ironically now one of the most competitive, capitalistic economies in the world, this existence without purpose has culminated in multiple movements by now, from the <i>sanhe</i> gods who live like kings on payday, to those who <i>lay flat</i> and <i>touch fish</i> at work.
