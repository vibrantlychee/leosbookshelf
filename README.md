# automator
A bare bones content management system (CMS) I made to automate the publishing 
of content. It is a simple python script that uses the Notion API endpoints to 
grab all data of a written post such as the body text, poster image, inline 
images, etc., then writes them into the appropriate HTML, CSS, and image files 
to be inserted into this repo. It also automatically updates `index.html`.

The high level process:
1. I write my post on Notion.
2. I use steps 1-7 set out in the **usage** section below. 
3. I `add`, `commit`, and `push` the changes to this repo to publish new post to 
the web. 

## Usage
In a terminal window whose working director is the highest level of this repo, 
run:
1. `python automator/run.py`
2. Enter Notion authentication token and public URL to Notion page as prompted.
3. Wait for success message. If successful, new files will have been written to 
this repo. 
5. `add`, `commit`, and `push` changes. 
6. Wait for changes to propagate. 
7. Check https://leosbookshelf.page/ for changes.
